# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

In this challenge, I used the US apparel product review from Amazon, with the goal to see if it be worth to subscribe to a Vine program if I were to sell similar apparel through this platform. I was able to use Pyspark to extract, transform and load the ETL data to my AWS RDS account in which I created.Using PPostgreSQL, I was able to query the data, create tables and create a CSV file.  From there, I used Pandas to extract the CSV file data, and then analized the the data.
